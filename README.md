# BigPanda DevOps Exercise - Yoad Submission
## INTRO
Hey! so my name is Yoad, and this is my submit for the excercise, hope you'd like it :)

### Actions
So what i've done is basically that

1.) I've created the requested services (if i understood those correctly :)) using node js.
2.) Instead of creating a role for each, i've decided to create a common role for the node.js apps, as it would be easier
to update it - just copy a new app to the folder and add it's name to the vars file.
3.) Everything else should be documented within the yaml files and inside the node projects
