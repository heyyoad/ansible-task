# BigPanda DevOps Exercise - Yoad Submission
## INTRO
Hey! so my name is Yoad, and this is my submission of the excercise, hope you'd like it :)

### Actions
So what i've done is basically:

* I've created the requested services (if i understood those correctly :)) using node js.
* Instead of creating a role for each, i've decided to create a common role for the node.js apps, as it would be easier to update it - just copy a new app to the folder and add a new dict to the vars file.
* I've decided to use pm2 for local deployment of the node apps and for "local" monitoring.
* In case i forgot something - everything else should be documented within the yaml files and inside the node projects files.
